  No assumption on distribution of

  Features are conditionally independent
  given the class.

  For quantitative predictors, transform
  the data to categories (Break Points). 

  Because of independent predictor it may
  be strong. Zero frequency is solved by smoothing technique.

  
  
  Yes

  
 
 
  
  LDA

  
  
  Qualitative

  Categorical

  
  
  Quantitative

  
  
  The observations are a random sample.

  Each predictor variable is normally distributed.

  Every class has the same variance/ covariance. 

   

  
  
   Yes

  
 
 
  
  QDA

  
  
  Qualitative

  
  
  Quantitative

  
  
  Every class has the separate variance/ covariance.

  
  
   

  
 
 
  
  KNN

  
  
  Qualitative

  
  
  Quantitative

  
  
  Using both
  training and test data
  together in analysis

  The distance function may matter.

   

  
  
  Yes
